# Welcome to my website !

I hold a dual master's degree in Economics and Business Administration from the University of Lausanne (HEC) and aspire to pursue a Ph.D. program in Macroeconomics next year. I have advanced programming (R addict and Matlab/Dynare enthusiast) and econometrics/modelling skills.

My main research interests include climate change, international macroeconomics, macro-finance, forecasting, time series analysis.

My experience includes research positions as a trainee at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html), at [the National Bank of Romania](https://www.bnr.ro/National-Bank-of-Romania-1144-Mobile.aspx) and at the [Swiss Institute of Applied Economics (CREA)](https://www.unil.ch/crea/home.html). I was also economic consultant intern at [Panth√©on Recherche](https://www.pantheon-recherche.com/).

I have also served as a Teaching Assistant at HEC Lausanne in Econometrics and Advanced Microeconomics classes.

Outside academia, I am the author of the economics textbook ["L'Economie en 50 graphiques"](https://www.dunod.com/prepas-concours/economie-en-50-graphiques-pour-reussir-vos-concours), widely available in French bookstores and consistently ranked among the top 10 economics student books in France.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:viktor.gradoux@hotmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects. \
